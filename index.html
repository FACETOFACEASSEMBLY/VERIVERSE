      <h2>The Idea</h2>
      <p>The idea of VeriVerse is to create a society-driven ecosystem where skills, dreams, and hustles connect in meaningful ways. It is not another platform chasing trends, but a living marketplace where people exchange value instead of validation, and where every individual has the chance to grow through trust, collaboration, and purpose.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 2 -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>The Vision</h2>
      <p>The vision of VeriVerse is to rebuild how humans connect, trade, and grow — one honest interaction at a time. It is a society where opportunity flows freely, where collaboration bridges boundaries, and where growth is shared by all.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 3 -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>The Mission</h2>
      <p>The mission of VeriVerse is to make digital society real — a place where every person, no matter their background, can belong, build, and be valued. It is about creating communities that grow together, where reputation is earned through contribution, and futures are shaped by collective strength.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 4 -->
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Why It Works</h2>
      <p>VeriVerse works because it brings balance to what the world often separates: technology with trust, freedom with responsibility, and humanity with progress. It transforms connection into currency and empowers people to turn society into strength.</p>
